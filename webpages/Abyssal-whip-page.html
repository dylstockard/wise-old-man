[[File:Abyssal whip detail.png|130px|left]]
The '''abyssal whip''' is a one-handed [[Melee weapon]] which requires an [[Attack]] level of 70 to wield. The whip is among the most powerful and popular non-degradable melee weapons and is capable of attacking at the same speed of [[daggers]] and [[scimitars]] at 2.4 seconds per hit. As it performs great against monsters that are weak to [[Attack types|slash]] attacks and is relatively affordable, it is one of the most widely used melee weapons in the game and is a popular choice used to train the [[Slayer]] skill at higher combat levels before more powerful weapons become accessible.

The whip is a big upgrade over the [[dragon scimitar]], which has the same attack speed but significantly lower accuracy and strength bonuses. However, it is easily outperformed by higher tier weapons such as [[Osmumten's fang]], [[Inquisitor's mace]], [[Blade of saeldor|Blade of Saeldor]] and the [[Ghrazi rapier]]. A major downside of the abyssal whip is that it is not effective for training [[Strength]]; the only attack option available which will provide Strength [[experience]] is the "lash" attack option, which is a [[controlled]] attack style and provides shared experience. As a result, several slightly weaker weapons are instead ideal for training Strength directly. 

Using a [[Shattered relics variety ornament kit]] on an abyssal whip will change its appearance into that of an [[abyssal whip (or)]]. Players can also use either a [[volcanic whip mix|volcanic]] or [[frozen whip mix]], obtained from [[Justine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standing]] to cosmetically enhance the abyssal whip, creating a [[volcanic abyssal whip]] or a [[frozen abyssal whip]], respectively. This only alters its appearance, and causes the whip to become untradeable. It can be reverted by using a [[cleaning cloth]] on the whip, but the mix will not be returned. 

Players can attach a [[kraken tentacle]] to the abyssal whip to create an [[abyssal tentacle]], which requires an [[Attack]] level of 75 and has +8 higher [[slash]] attack and +4 higher [[Strength#Strength bonus|Strength bonus]], equating to about 1 higher damage. This process, however, will cause the whip to be consumed, and cannot be undone. Once the abyssal tentacle consumes all of its 10,000 charges, the player will retain the kraken tentacle.

==Special attack==
[[File:Energy Drain.gif|frame|A player performing the abyssal whip's special attack, ''Energy drain''.]]
The abyssal whip has a [[special attack]], ''Energy Drain'', which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy, increases accuracy by 25%, and in [[Player killing|PvP]], transfers 10% of the target's run energy to the wielder. The target player will receive the message, "You feel drained!" in their chat window. The accuracy roll for ''Energy Drain'' is made against an opponents slash defence.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/904101556034920449|date=2 September 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/8SP3j|archivedate=24 December 2022|quote=[Are whip & dscim spec tooltips correct? Supposedly more accurate, but my experience has been exactly the opposite. (...)] Both have a 25% accuracy buff, rolling against your opponent's effective slash defence.}}

==Trivia==
* The whip is made from the spine of an abyssal demon.{{CiteTwitter|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/E1Na4|archivedate=16 April 2022|author=Official RuneScape|url=https://twitter.com/runescape/status/999168549032640512|quote=Did you know, the Abyssal Whip is crafted from the spine of an abyssal demon ðŸ‘¿ Question: How do you recognize a real abyssal whip from a fake one? (Â© _Manks / Reddit) #WednesdayWisdom|date=23 May 2018}}
*Like other slash weapons, an abyssal whip can be used in lieu of a [[knife]] when [[Sliced banana|slicing]] [[banana]]s despite having no apparent blade. It can also be used to slice through [[web]]s.
*The whip has an odd value of 120,001 so that it is always kept on death ahead of a [[Mystic robe top]]. Previously, players would scam whip owners by luring them to the Wilderness, giving them three robe tops and then killing them. The victim would keep the robe tops on death as opposed to the much more valuable whip.
