The '''Tzhaar-ket-om''', also known as the '''obsidian maul''', is a weapon that requires a [[Strength]] level of 60 to wield. It is a two-handed weapon. It is affected by the [[Berserker necklace]], receiving a 20% damage increase when the necklace is worn. It is also affected by the [[Obsidian armour]] ([[obsidian helmet|helmet]], [[obsidian platebody|platebody]] and [[obsidian platelegs|platelegs]]) which will increase the melee attack and melee strength by 10%. These damage bonuses '''do''' stack with each other.

Two of these are used to build an [[obsidian fence]] at level 83 [[Construction]] in a player's [[Superior Garden]].

The maul is used commonly by [[Obsidian mauler]]s in [[player-killing]] because the only requirement is a Strength level of 60, which makes it possible to have a low [[Combat level]] while being able to deal high amounts of damage. However, one major drawback of this weapon is its poor [[attack speed]].

The maximum hit in standard PvP combat with the maul is '''63'''. This can be done by wearing an Obsidian helmet, platebody, platelegs, [[Berserker necklace]], [[Berserker ring (i)]], [[Infernal cape]], [[Barrows gloves]], and [[Primordial boots|Primordial]]/[[Dragon boots]], and using a [[Super combat potion]] while having [[Piety]] active.

Players can attach a [[Tzhaar-ket-om ornament kit]], obtained from [[Clue scroll (hard)|hard]] [[Treasure Trails]], to create a [[Tzhaar-ket-om (t)]]. This is only cosmetic, and does not affect the maul's stat bonuses. It can be dismantled, returning the maul and ornament kit.
