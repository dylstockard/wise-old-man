The '''dragon scimitar''' is the strongest [[scimitar]] available in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]''. It can only be wielded by players who have 60 [[Attack]] and have completed the [[Monkey Madness I]] quest. It also shares similar bonuses with [[Viggora's chainmace]], with the chainmace being a [[crush weapon]] rather than a [[slash weapon]].

It may be purchased from [[Daga]] on [[Ape Atoll]] for 100,000 coins. A [[Monkeyspeak amulet]] does not need to be worn, as players can just right-click 'Trade' on Daga; however, you still must be in [[Greegree|monkey form]], unless you have completed [[Monkey Madness II]] after which the monkey form is no longer required. Players who have freed [[King Awowogei]] in [[Recipe for Disaster]] can easily reach [[Marim]] through the [[Ape Atoll Teleport (standard)|Ape Atoll Teleport]] spell (requires 64 [[Magic]]) to access [[Daga's Scimitar Smithy|Daga's shop]] on Ape Atoll more quickly. The scimitar is also a rare drop from the [[Wilderness]] boss [[Scorpia]].

Players can attach a [[dragon scimitar ornament kit]], obtained from [[elite clue scroll]]s, to cosmetically enhance the scimitar, creating a [[dragon scimitar (or)]]. This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It can be dismantled, returning the scimitar and ornament kit.

As with most [[dragon equipment]], the dragon scimitar '''cannot''' be made from raw materials using the [[Smithing]] skill.

==Special attack==
[[File:Sever.gif|frame|A player performing the dragon scimitar's special attack, ''Sever''.]]
The dragon scimitar has a [[special attacks|special attack]], ''Sever'', costing 55% of the player's special attack energy. Sever rolls against the target's slash defence with 25% higher accuracy,{{CiteForum|author=Bitterkoekje|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905124128/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?317,318,712,65587452|title=Combat Formulas|postdate=10 March 2015|name=Bitterkoekje}} and prevents the target ('''players only''') from using the [[Protect from Magic]], [[Protect from Missiles]], and [[Protect from Melee]] prayers for 5 seconds.

==Comparison with other weapons==
The dragon scimitar is one of the most easily attainable one-handed training weapons in the game, with the [[Ghrazi rapier]], [[Blade of saeldor]], [[Abyssal tentacle]], [[Abyssal whip]], [[Abyssal dagger]], [[Zamorakian hasta]], [[Staff of the dead]], [[Inquisitor's mace]], [[Osmumten's fang]], and the [[Sarachnis cudgel]] outperforming it. However, due to whips and hastae being unable to solely train strength, the dragon scimitar is often used to do so, and is therefore one of the most commonly used weapons in the game to train strength.

In comparison, the [[Saradomin sword]] offers a +82 Strength bonus and +82 [[Slash]] attack. [[Saradomin's blessed sword]] offers a +88 Strength bonus and +100 slash attack. The [[Abyssal whip]] offers a +82 Strength bonus and +82 slash attack. The [[Abyssal dagger]] offers a +75 Strength bonus and +75 stab attack.

==Trivia==
*The dragon scimitar was not actually released until almost four months after the release of the [[Monkey Madness I]] quest on [[29 March]] [[2005]].
*If the player asked [[Zeke]] to sell them a dragon scimitar, he would say, "Seriously, you'll be a monkey's uncle before you'll ever hold a dragon scimitar." The joke is that in Monkey Madness I, the player plays the role of a monkey's uncle to complete a certain part of the quest, and completing the quest is required to wield the dragon scimitar.
*The Dragon scimitar originally had a [[Special attacks|special attack]] that stopped your opponent from moving for a short period of time but Jagex later changed it in [[Update:Dragon Scimitar Change|an update]] to stop protection prayers instead.
